# ImageJ deconvolve richardsonLucyTV

This plugin applies the [Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson%E2%80%93Lucy_deconvolution) to input collection with 
a total variation regularization factor as described in (Richardson-Lucy 
algorithm with total variation regularization for 3D confocal microscope 
deconvolution Microsc Res Rech 2006 Apr; 69(4)- 260-6). This is an iterative 
process that can recover an underlying blurred image if the psf 
(point spread function) mask of the image is known or can be estimated.

This WIPP plugin was automatically generated by a utility that searches for
ImageJ plugins and generates code to run them. For more information on what this
plugin does, contact one of the authors: Nick Schaub (nick.schaub@nih.gov), 
Anjali Taneja or Benjamin Houghton (benjamin.houghton@axleinfo.com).
