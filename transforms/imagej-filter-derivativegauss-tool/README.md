# ImageJ filter derivativegauss v(0.5.1)

This plugin applies the nth derivative of a Gaussian to an input collection. The
plugin takes as input the standard deviations of the 2-Dimensional Gaussian for
both dimensions (x,y) and then takes the nth partial derivatives of the Gaussian
before applying the filter to an image. Note only partial derivatives of 0, 1 or
2 are supported by the ImageJ implementation.

This WIPP plugin was automatically generated by a utility that searches for
ImageJ plugins and generates code to run them. For more information on what this
plugin does, contact one of the authors: Nick Schaub (nick.schaub@nih.gov),
Anjali Taneja or Benjamin Houghton (benjamin.houghton@axleinfo.com).
