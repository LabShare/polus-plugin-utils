# ImageJ filter dog v(0.5.0-dev0)

This plugin applies the Difference of Gaussians algorithm to an input collection.
The [DoG algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians) involves blurring the input image with with two separate
Gaussian filters, of varying standard deviation, then subtracting them from one
another to produce the final output image.

This WIPP plugin was automatically generated by a utility that searches for
ImageJ plugins and generates code to run them. For more information on what this
plugin does, contact one of the authors: Nick Schaub (nick.schaub@nih.gov),
Anjali Taneja or Benjamin Houghton (benjamin.houghton@axleinfo.com).
