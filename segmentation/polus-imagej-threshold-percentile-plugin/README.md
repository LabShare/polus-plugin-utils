# ImageJ threshold percentile

As described by [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/plugins/auto-threshold#percentile) 
this plugin assumes the fraction of foreground pixels to be 0.5. This method was 
proposed in Doyle, W. (1962). Operations Useful for Similarity-Invariant Pattern 
Recognition. Journal of the ACM, 9(2), 259â€“267.

This WIPP plugin was automatically generated by a utility that searches for
ImageJ plugins and generates code to run them. For more information on what this
