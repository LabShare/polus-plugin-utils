# ImageJ threshold triangle

This plugin implements the triangle threshold method. As desbrined by [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/plugins/auto-threshold#triangle)
the Triangle algorithm, a geometric method, cannot tell whether the data is 
skewed to one side or another, but assumes a maximum peak (mode) near one end of 
the histogram and searches towards the other end. This causes a problem in the 
absence of information of the type of image to be processed, or when the maximum 
is not near one of the histogram extremes (resulting in two possible threshold 
regions between that max and the extremes). Here the algorithm was extended to 
find on which side of the max peak the data goes the furthest and searches for 
the threshold within that largest range.
