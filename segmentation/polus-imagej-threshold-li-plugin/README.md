# ImageJ threshold li

Implements Li’s Minimum Cross Entropy thresholding method based on the iterative 
version of the algorithm. This is an iterative method to find the threshold 
value which minimizes the cross entropy between the segmented image and the 
orginal image as described in: Li, C. H., & Tam, P. K. S. (1998). An iterative 
algorithm for minimum cross entropy thresholding. Pattern Recognition Letters, 
19(8), 771–776. [doi:10.1016/s0167-8655(98)00057-9 (PDF)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865598000579?via%3Dihub).


This WIPP plugin was automatically generated by a utility that searches for
ImageJ plugins and generates code to run them. For more information on what this

## Building

Bump the verison in the `VERSION` file.

Then oo build the Docker image for the conversion plugin, run
`./build-docker.sh`.
