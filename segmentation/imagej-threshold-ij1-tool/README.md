# ImageJ threshold huang (v0.5.1-dev0)

This plugin implements the [default thresholding method](https://imagej.net/plugins/auto-threshold#default) from ImageJ 1.x. The
default method as explained by ImageJ is a variation of the IsoData algorithm.
As explained by ImageJ the IsoData "procedure divides the image into object and
background by taking an initial threshold, then the averages of the pixels at or
below the threshold and pixels above are computed. The averages of those two
values are computed, the threshold is incremented and the process is repeated
until the threshold is larger than the composite average. That is,"

`threshold = (average background + average objects)/2.`

This WIPP plugin was automatically generated by a utility that searches for ImageJ plugins and generates code to run them.
