# ImageJ threshold otsu

As described by [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/plugins/auto-threshold#otsu), Otsu’s 
threshold clustering algorithm searches for the threshold that minimizes 
the intra-class variance, defined as a weighted sum of variances of the two 
classes.

Also see the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu's_method) for 
this operation. The algorithm was proposed in Otsu, N. (1979). A Threshold 
Selection Method from Gray-Level Histograms. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, 
and Cybernetics, 9(1), 62–66. [doi:10.1109/tsmc.1979.4310076](https://doi.org/10.1109/tsmc.1979.4310076)
