# ImageJ threshold mean

Uses the mean of grey levels as the threshold. It is used by some other methods 
as a first guess threshold. The operation is further described in Glasbey, C. A. 
(1993). An Analysis of Histogram-Based Thresholding Algorithms. CVGIP: Graphical 
Models and Image Processing, 55(6), 532â€“537. [doi:10.1006/cgip.1993.1040](https://doi.org/10.1006/cgip.1993.1040)

This WIPP plugin was automatically generated by a utility that searches for
