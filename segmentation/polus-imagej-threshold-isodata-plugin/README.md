# ImageJ threshold isoData

Iterative procedure based on the isodata algorithm of:  Picture Thresholding 
Using an Iterative Selection Method. (1978). IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, 
and Cybernetics, 8(8), 630â€“632. doi:10.1109/tsmc.1978.4310039. As described by
[ImageJ](https://imagej.net/plugins/auto-threshold#isodata) the procedure divides the image into object and background by taking an 
initial threshold, then the averages of the pixels at or below the threshold and 
pixels above are computed. The averages of those two values are computed, the 
threshold is incremented and the process is repeated until the threshold is 
larger than the composite average. That is,

`threshold = (average background + average objects)/2.`

This WIPP plugin was automatically generated by a utility that searches for
ImageJ plugins and generates code to run them. For more information on what this
plugin does, contact one of the authors: Nick Schaub (nick.schaub@nih.gov), 
Anjali Taneja or Benjamin Houghton (benjamin.houghton@axleinfo.com).

## Building

Bump the verison in the `VERSION` file.

Then oo build the Docker image for the conversion plugin, run
`./build-docker.sh`.
