# ImageJ threshold minimum (v0.5.1-dev0)

As described by [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/plugins/auto-threshold#minimum) this
operation is similar to the Intermodes method, this assumes a bimodal histogram.
The histogram is iteratively smoothed using a running average of size 3, until
there are only two local maxima. The threshold value is then selected as the
minimum pixel value between the two bimodal peaks. This algorithm is presented
in Prewitt, J. M. S., & Mendelsohn, M. L. (2006). THE ANALYSIS OF CELL IMAGES*.
Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 128(3), 1035â€“1053.
