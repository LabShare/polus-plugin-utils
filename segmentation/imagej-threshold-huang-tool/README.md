# ImageJ threshold huang (v0.5.1)

This plugin implements Huang's threshold method proposed in Image Thresholding by Minimizing the Measures of Fuzziness, Huang (1995).
This method determines an optimal thresholding value such that the fuzziness measure between the original image and its binary version is minimized.

This WIPP plugin was automatically generated by a utility that searches for ImageJ plugins and generates code to run them.
