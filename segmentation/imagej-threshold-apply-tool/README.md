# ImageJ threshold apply

This plugin applies a constant manual threshold value to an input collection.
(Thresholding)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_(image_processing)] converts all pixel values in an image to either 1 or 0 depending on
if the input pixel value is above or below a given value. While there are more
complex thresholding algorithms this plugin implements the most
basic form of thresholding as previously described.

This WIPP plugin was automatically generated by a utility that searches for
ImageJ plugins and generates code to run them. For more information on what this
plugin does, contact one of the authors: Nick Schaub (nick.schaub@nih.gov),
Anjali Taneja or Benjamin Houghton (benjamin.houghton@axleinfo.com).
